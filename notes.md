focus on basic concepts, theoretical considerations
focus on 'how to get started'

## Part 1. Social media basics (10 min)

### What are social media?!
- facebook, twitter
- very unclear
- youth? (ask your teenager child/sibling/friend)

Greenhow 2016: Examples of social media include social network sites (eg., Facebook); wikis (eg., wikispaces); media- sharing services (eg., YouTube); blogging tools (eg., Blogger); micro-blogging services (eg., Twitter); social bookmarking (eg., Delicious); bibliographic management tools (eg., Zotero); and presentation-sharing tools (eg., Slideshare) (Gruzd, Staves and Wilk 2012).

### Pair & Share: your definition of social media

social media, web 2.0
social network site (the focus here)

### Present definitions (Obar)

1. Social media services are (currently) Web 2.0 Internet-based applications
2. User-generated content is the lifeblood of social media
3. Individuals and groups create user-specific profiles for a site or app designed and maintained by a social media service
4. Social media services facilitate the development of social networks online by connecting a profile with those of other individuals and/or groups

### Twitter for example
- participatory form of mass media
- socially connected and information diffusion focused (Chang, 2010)

Goggins Figure

### Github for example
- different

### Meta things

What are the real costs?
- "Usually the only cost is the time of the end-user." (Bates)
- really?

Control vs. freedom:
- "We therefore need a middle ground between the total authority and control of the teacher, and the complete anarchy of the children roaming free on a desert island in the novel “Lord of the Flies”"

## Part 2. Social media for learning

### Educational affordances (Bates, Greenhow, Siemens & Downes)
- connectivity (interconnections)
- information sharing, information discovery
- content creation, remixing
- interactivity

connectivist ideas (Siemens 2005), which view learning as the process of creating connections and articulating a network with nodes and relationships
- From the connectivist perspective, being knowledgeable can be seen as the ability to nurture, maintain, and traverse network connections; to access and use specialized information sources just-in-time; and as the ‘capacity to know more’ rather than the individual’s ability to construct meaning from prior knowledge, or ‘what is currently known’ (Siemens 2005, 4).

Very different from using Facebook to poll students

### Pair & Share
What educational use of social media you're involved in?
How is learning conceptualized?
- Where?
- Who? (and with whom?)
- How?
- For what? (e.g. info sharing, argumentation, civic action)

### Present

Greenhow 2016, table 1

Greenhow 2009:
- learner participation and creative practices
- online identity formation

participation and affiliation (Goggins Table 1)
different kinds of social learning analytics (Buckingham Shum, S., & Ferguson)

### Some cases

- LAK conference community / LASI (last year or this year?)
- an cMOOC
- an informal CoP on Twitter
- annotation stuff (what case?)

### One case to focus on here

?
- Where?
- Who? (and with whom?)
- For what? (institutional goals & true aims)

## Part 3. Collecting social media data

Twitter data
- TAGS

API route
- Hypothesis data

Storing data
- csv
- mysql alike
- Neo4j

## Part 4. Mining social media data

Mining what?
Going back to the conceptualization of learning

Now mining...

connectivity is what you are looking for
- SNA is an obvious choice
- participation and affiliation (Goggins Table 1)
- influence (Goggins 2014)
- modularity
- change over time

modelling (someone?)

information sharing within a network
- extract URLs
- text mining (Anatonly Guzd)

modelling

content creation (collaborative)
- KBDeX (Matsuzawa)
- quantitative ethnography (Shaffer)
